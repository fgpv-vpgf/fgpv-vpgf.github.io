	<strong>(service)</strong>

	<p><p>The <code>stateManager</code> factory is a service controlling states (true/false) of panels and their content.
State object corresponds to either a panel with mutually exclusive content panes, a content pane, or any other element with set content. For simplicity, a state object which is a parent, cannot be a child of another state object.</p>
<p>When a parent state object is:</p>
<ul>
<li>activated: it activates a first (random) child as well; activating a parent state object should be avoided;</li>
<li>deactivated: it deactivates its active child as well;</li>
</ul>
<p>When a child state object is:</p>
<ul>
<li>activated: it activates its parent and deactivates its active sibling if any;</li>
<li>deactivated: it deactivates its parent as well;</li>
</ul>
<p>Only <code>active</code> and <code>morph</code> state properties are animated (animation can be skipped which is indicated by the <code>activeSkip</code> and <code>morphSkip</code> flags) and need to be set through <code>setActive</code> and <code>setMorph</code> functions accordingly; these properties can be bound and watched directly though. Everything else on the <code>state</code> object can be set, bound, and watched directly.</p>
